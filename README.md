Data Analysis and Visualization: <br />
I downloaded the New York City Airbnb Dataset from Kaggle Platform. This is a very rich dataset with many columns to explore and mine. <br />
First, we identified the top 10 hosts with most listings and visualized their hosted locations in a map using latitude and longitude data. We found that the top host has 327 listings and Manhattan region is the preferable choice for top hosts. <br />
After that, we analyzed the listings by boroughs and neighbourhoods. Specifically, we plotted counts in pie chart and found that Manhattan and Brooklyn counts for most of the listings. Besides, we visualized price differences in violin chart and density plot. We could see that Manhattan is the most expensive region, while the Bronx region is the least expensive region. <br /> 
Then we analyzed the room types by plotting histograms and density plot. We found that the 'entire room/apt' is the most expensive, while the 'shared room' is the least expensive.
